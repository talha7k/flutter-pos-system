# Firebase Configuration Setup

## Security Notice

This repository has been secured by removing all hardcoded Firebase API keys and sensitive configuration data. To run this application, you need to configure your own Firebase project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or use an existing one
3. Enable the services you need (Authentication, Firestore, etc.)

### 2. Configure Firebase for Flutter

1. Install the Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Install FlutterFire CLI:
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

3. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

4. Configure FlutterFire for your project:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

This will generate the proper `firebase_options.dart` file with your project's configuration.

### 3. iOS Configuration

For iOS, you'll also need to:

1. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your Firebase project console
2. Place it in `ios/Runner/` directory
3. Add it to your Xcode project

### 4. Android Configuration

For Android:

1. Download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project console
2. Place it in `android/app/` directory

### 5. Environment-Specific Configuration (Optional)

For different environments (dev, staging, prod), you can create separate Firebase projects and configuration files:

- `firebase_options.dev.dart`
- `firebase_options.prod.dart`

Then modify your app to load the appropriate configuration based on the build flavor.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit real API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data in CI/CD pipelines
3. **Rotate API keys** regularly
4. **Restrict API key usage** in Firebase console to specific platforms and services
5. **Monitor API key usage** for unusual activity

## Files to Keep Private

The following files contain sensitive data and should never be committed:

- `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire)
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- Any environment-specific Firebase configuration files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you've run `flutterfire configure` in your project root
2. Verify that your Firebase project has the necessary services enabled
3. Check that your bundle ID/package name matches your Firebase app configuration
4. Ensure you've added the configuration files to the correct directories

## Additional Security Measures

Consider implementing:

1. **Firebase App Check** to protect your backend resources
2. **Security Rules** for Firestore and Storage
3. **API key restrictions** in Google Cloud Console
4. **Regular security audits** of your Firebase configuration
